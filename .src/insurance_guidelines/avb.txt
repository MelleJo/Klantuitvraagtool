Guidelines for Bedrijfsaansprakelijkheidsverzekering (AVB):

1. Explain that this insurance covers damage to persons or property caused by the company or its employees.
2. Emphasize the importance of the correct business description (hoedanigheid) on the policy.
3. Discuss the "opzicht" clause and its relevance to the client's business.
4. Ask whether the client is a sole proprietor or has employees, as this affects the coverage.
5. Mention that damage caused by motor vehicles is excluded from this insurance.
6. Offer to make a premium comparison calculation.
7. Structure the advice as follows:
   a. Brief explanation of what AVB covers
   b. Current situation (coverage amount, business description)
   c. Potential risks or gaps in coverage
   d. Recommendations
   e. Question for engagement
