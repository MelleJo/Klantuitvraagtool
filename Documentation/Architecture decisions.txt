# Klantuitvraagtool: Architecture Decisions

## 1. Single-Page Web Application
- **Decision**: Utilize Streamlit to create a single-page web application.
- **Rationale**: Simplifies development, deployment, and user interaction. Streamlit's Python-based approach aligns with the project's AI and data processing needs.

## 2. Stateless Architecture
- **Decision**: Implement a stateless architecture using Streamlit's session state for temporary data storage.
- **Rationale**: Enhances security by not persisting sensitive client data, simplifies scaling, and reduces data management complexities.

## 3. Modular Component Structure
- **Decision**: Organize the application into modular components (input processing, analysis, recommendation, report generation).
- **Rationale**: Improves maintainability, allows for easier testing and updates of individual components.

## 4. API-Driven NLP Processing
- **Decision**: Utilize OpenAI's API for core NLP tasks (GPT-4 for analysis, Whisper for transcription).
- **Rationale**: Leverages state-of-the-art AI models without the need for in-house AI infrastructure, allowing focus on application-specific development.

## 5. Asynchronous Processing for Long-Running Tasks
- **Decision**: Implement asynchronous processing for tasks like audio transcription and extensive text analysis.
- **Rationale**: Improves user experience by preventing UI freezes during long-running operations.

## 6. Client-Side Processing for Basic Tasks
- **Decision**: Perform basic data validation and preprocessing on the client side where possible.
- **Rationale**: Reduces server load and improves responsiveness for simple operations.

## 7. Separation of Concerns in Code Structure
- **Decision**: Clearly separate UI components, business logic, and data processing into distinct modules.
- **Rationale**: Enhances code readability, maintainability, and allows for easier future expansions or modifications.

## 8. Configurable Prompts and Templates
- **Decision**: Store AI prompts and report templates as configurable files separate from the main code.
- **Rationale**: Allows for easy updates and tweaks to AI behavior and output formats without changing core code.

## 9. Comprehensive Logging and Error Handling
- **Decision**: Implement detailed logging throughout the application and centralized error handling.
- **Rationale**: Facilitates debugging, performance monitoring, and enhances the ability to identify and resolve issues quickly.

## 10. Scalable Cloud Deployment
- **Decision**: Deploy on Streamlit Cloud with potential for containerization.
- **Rationale**: Provides a straightforward initial deployment solution with the option to scale or migrate to other cloud platforms if needed in the future.

## 11. Minimal External Dependencies
- **Decision**: Limit the use of external libraries to essential, well-maintained packages.
- **Rationale**: Reduces potential security vulnerabilities and simplifies dependency management.

## 12. API Abstraction Layer
- **Decision**: Create an abstraction layer for API interactions.
- **Rationale**: Allows for easier switching or upgrading of AI services in the future, and centralizes API credential management.

These architecture decisions are designed to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable application that meets the project's requirements while allowing for future growth and modifications.
